# Gericht-Restaurant

In this project I built a Modern UI/UX Restaurant landing page with React and CSS. 
During this project I learned the follwoing:

- React Functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
- Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
- From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
- And at the end you'll learn how to deploy your websites to extremely fast servers and give them a custom domain name.
